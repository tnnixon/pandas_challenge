I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The company would like to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

Observations
The majority of Pymoli players identify as male making up almost 85% of the total players. Although they outnumber the other players, the players who identify as female or other spend about 50 cents more per purchase per person than the males. The majority of Pymoli players fall into the 20-24 age range. Players under 10 years old are second in average purchase price and average total per person despite having access to their own credit cards. The late 30s age range preceeds them in this category. Of the top 5 spenders, the two players with the least amount of purchases spent the most money per purchase. The top two most popular items are also the most profitable items along with Fiery Glass Crusader.
